# dimension_reduction_EVs
t-SNE based dimension reduction for extracellular vesicles

Dimensionality reduction using t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding). 
The input parameters are the mechanical and biophysical properties of EVs from a combined atomic force and fluorescence microscope platform:
1) Size
2) Fluorescence intensities of three different channels
3) Stiffness (young's modulus)
